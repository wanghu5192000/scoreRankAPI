# scoreRankAPI
A tiny restful api to store and rank customer scores concurrently, it is my answer to an interview task. The task description is in the 'interview Codes for donnet-updated.pdf'.
The idea is to store the customer scores to different buckets according to the score value. At first there is only one bucket, then it splits to more buckets as more and more scores stored. A bucket itself is a sortedlist, the leaderboard is generated by combine the proper buckets one by one, rank is the ordinal of the leaderboarditem.
